Min-init

Based on mininit from Ignacio Garcia Perez
(http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-linux/)

This simple program permits to use a romfs/squashfs image as the root filesystem of a linux system.
You will need to specify three parameters on the kernel command line:
- 'boot=X' where X is a comma-separated list of the possible locations for the filesystem on which is stored the image;
- 'loop0=X' where X is the path to the image (e.g. /boot/rootfs.bin);
- 'root=/dev/loop0' which defines the loopback mount as being the root file system.

For each path specified as an argument of the 'boot' kernel parameter, min-init will try to mount the corresponding drive with every filesystem type the kernel understands, until the mount eventually succeeds.

To compile, pass your cross compiler to Make via the CC variable.
For example:
$ make CC=mipsel-gcw0-linux-uclibc-gcc
